They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town  
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you  
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew  
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon  
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room  
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap  
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap  
Cause girl your momma should of taught you better  
I'ma sit down and write you a long letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
  
I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was  
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant cause  
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume  
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom  
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone  
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was ""Moan"".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't really know if the story is so  
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe  
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe  
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho  
In every disco you say hello  
Like you're a little angel, but we all know  
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way  
You always got in bed when you wanted to play  
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva  
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro  
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow  
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze  
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.  
That's a General Education on Decency  
One day you'll see, and agree with me  
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93  
For you there's no fee, everything is free  
This is from me to you, not you to me  
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight  
You try to shake your butt with all your might  
I don't really wanna dis nobody  
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette  
How bad can a girl's reputation get?  
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met  
If you're desperate ask Yvette, cause she'll say ""Bet"".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
B-Boys are hard on the boulevard  
The Reverend at the church said you was barred  
Homeboys on the block love you a lot  
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not  
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'  
Let me explain to you who is talkin'  
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way  
You boogie down to my records almost every day  
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still  
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill  
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.  
The guy at the desk said it was OK  
For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay  
Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

When we hit top end you know it feels to slow  
Said you wanna get your order filled  
Made me shiver when I put it in

At turning a screw than me  
I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearings from the heat  
Oh yeah yeah  
Oh!  
  
I'm giving you my room service  
And ya know it's more than enough  
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love

I do it for my life  
Made my drive shaft crank  
Made my pistons bulge  
Melt my ball bearing from the heat

Imagine you were at my station  
And you brought your motor to me  
With all four on the floor I feel what's in store

Listen to the night  
Loud as Hell and black as death  
Only men take fright  
Sit around my flame bright  
Warm your bones and hear  
Virgins die and demons cry  
Throw away your fears  
Suffer not the children  
Sleep tight our fathers  
Guard our mothers well  
Vampires and werewolves  
Erupt your dreams our spell  
The evening sabbat song  
A Longing to be free  
Lost children wander waiting  
Barefoot in the sea  
Suffer not the children  
Suffer not the children  
Or be deemed a damned disgrace  
Blessed be the wench  
To which delivers in his grace  
Gather around my young ones  
We can go away  
I'll guide you in the night  
Follow me  
Tonight we'll find a path  
The Hell born sinners trail  
Beware! None shall stop us  
Innocence guards our way  
The amulets of kings  
Our voodoo games  
We know but never tell  
Of our infernal names

Leavin' civilization  
  
And there were highways to get across  
And places far from here

And he was my wild frontier  
  
Harvested peaches in a small border town  
Saved all our wages  
Put ten percent down  
I never thought I'd see the world through a child's eyes  
Until early December  
  
Then one Calgary morning  
Still as glass  
While my baby lay sleeping, an angel slipped past  
And with one breath said I'm taking him back  
To his Father in Heaven  
  
Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow  
I held him through my tears  
Because I was his lonesome prairie

You'd think I would give up on love  
Get off this line

Sunshine turned to rainy days  
Yet here I am  
Ready to begin once again

Dreamin' dreams that always broke in two  
But I still believe in love  
And I love believing  
Maybe you can make my dreams come true

I'm reachin' out my hand to him

Dreamin' dreams that never quite came true

Waiting for you to change into something I  
Wish you could have been

Of a cottage by a stream  
With my man  
Where a few flowers grew

Like my man

Since that sad affair

Changed her style

There in the darkness I safely concealed

All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there  
  
Such is the promise, such is the curse  
You could just live your life better or worse  
Knowing the casual dreams up on that hill  
Beckons and sways but won't bend to your will  
  
You might find a river under a mountain that  
Feeds a remote, subterranean fountain  
Drink from this taste just a hint of a dream  
That some how leads in to the underground stream

Called love (called love)

In a cradle all night  
It swings (woo woo)  
It jives (woo woo)  
It shakes all over like a jelly fish  
I kinda like it  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
There goes my baby  
She knows how to rock 'n' roll  
She drives me crazy  
She gives me hot and cold fever  
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat  
  
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip  
And get on my track's  
Take a back seat, hitch-hike  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until I'm ready

As I gaze at the cold river bed  
Why do I ask myself, shall I go back

Where everything reflects your color  
Darkness that is endless  
Nights that leave me friendless, blue

Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded, too  
Why must you send  
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing  
Like shadows of love that are gone  
  
Where will it end  
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight  
And darken each promise of dawn

At times a step away  
From a common fear that's all spread out  
It won't listen to what you say

Once I reached for love

To ride the wings of dreams  
Into changing horizons

Wanted so bad to be part of the scene  
She met the man and she did the smack  
Paid the price layin' flat on her back  
Wanted so bad just to please the boys  
They ended up just being a toy  
Played so hard burned her life away  
Lies were told no promises made  
  
You know nice boys  
Don't play rock and roll  
Nice boys don't play rock and roll  
I'm not a nice boy and I never was!  
  
Young and fresh when she hit town  
Hot for kicks just to get around  
But now she lays in a filthy room  
She kills the pain with  
A flick and a spoon  
And in the streets the garbage lies  
Protected by a million flies

Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind  
And try to take the path less traveled by  
That first step you take is the longest stride  
  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?  
Would you live each moment like your last?  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?  
If today was your last day  
(If today was your last day)  
  
Against the grain should be a way of life  
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight  
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try  
So live like you'll never live it twice  
Don't take the free ride in your own life

Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies?  
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love  
If today was your last day  
  
If today was your last day  
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?  
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars  
Regardless of who you are

Let nothin' stand in your way

The Queen said: ""I'm aghast  
Love never seems to last  
However hard you try""  
And Di replied  
  
That there are no more lovers left alive  
No one has survived  
So there are no more lovers left alive

Diana dried her eyes  
And looked surprised

You can hear the music  
Of the AM radio  
  
The VCR and the DVD  
There was none of that crap  
Back in 1970  
We didn't know about a  
World Wide Web  
It was a whole different game  
Playin' back when  
I was a kid  
  
Want to get down in a cool way  
Picture yourself on a beautiful day  
Big bell bottoms and groovy long hair  
Just walkin' in style with a portable CD player  
No you'd listen to the music on the

Flashback, 72  
Another summer in the neighborhood  
Hanging out with nothing to do  
Sometimes we go driving around  
In my sister's pinto  
Cruising with the windows rolled down  
We listen to the radio station  
We were too damn cool  
To buy the eight track tape  
There wasn't any good time  
To want to be inside  
My mama want to watch that TV  
All goddamn night  
  
I'd be in bed with the radio on  
I would listen to it all night long  
Just to hear my favorite song  
You'd have to wait till you could hear it on the

I can still hear Mama say  
""Boy turn that radio down!""  
  
(Spoken ""Aw, Mom. Not that show again! I don't want to watch that show! Can't
we watch Good Times or Chico and the Man or something cool? Turn it off!)  
  
Things changed back in '75  
We were all growing up on the in and the outside  
We got in trouble with the police man  
We got busted getting high in the back of my friend's van  
I remember 1977  
I started going to concerts and I saw the Led Zeppelin  
I got a guitar on Christmas day  
I dreamed that Jimmy Page would come to  
Santa Monica to teach me to play  
Teach me to play  
  
There isn't any place that I need to go  
There isn't anything that I need to know  
That I did not learn on the radio  
  
Everything gets stupid and I just don't know

And the time will go by  
Till you never know where it's gone.  
Talk to me and I'll tell you my life story.  
Walk with me and I'll tell you my dreams of glory.  
There we are walking hand in hand,  
Somewhere on the sand  
At the end of the land  
And the edge of the shining sea.  
  
Drifting through time and space  
On the face of a little blue ball  
Falling around the sun.  
One in a million, billion twinkling lights  
Shining out for no one in the middle of the night.  
Here we are, sparks in the darkness,  
Speaking of our love  
Burning down forever and forever.  
  
Oh, I don't know if I told you,  
But you hold my heart in your hand.  
And I found out something about you, baby,  
Without you.  
I'm a lonely man.  
  
So though I never say that I love you,  
I love you, darling I do, Carly, I do love you.  
And though we are as nothing  
To the stars that shine above,  
You are my universe, you are my love.  
Here we are, like children forever,  
Taking care of one another  
While the world goes on without us,  
All around us.

Alright, alright.  
Y'all get my ash tray, get my lighter.  
I'm a read y'all a gangsta bedtime story.  
Come here, sit on my lap.  
(Okay.)  
Check it out.  
  
Great scotts, it's hot today  
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest  
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air  
His vision getting blurry but you know I didn't care  
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck  
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck  
Shooting like a motherfucking Vietnam vet  
Riding on this nigga disrespecting my set  
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots  
On the hood getting hot, anybody can drop  
You better have a spot up in town my nigga  
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga  
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat  
Grease strikes you out with no get back  
Wishing for a steak eating on a Kit Kat  
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that  
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me  
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me  
We can ride on some niggas for nothing at all  
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em  
LBC in this motherfucker cause  
I had to show these niggas what time it was  
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns  
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves  
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip  
Or better yet, strapped a clip  
To a motherfucking' nine millimeter for heater  
And put the ride down out of G two seater  
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that  
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that  
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back  
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack  
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack  
I brought the curl back and the golf hat  
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps  
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks  
I brought snaps to the game nigga  
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga  
S-N double O-P fa sho  
I do my thang way cut throat on the down-low  
Oh once upon a time in the LBC  
There lived a OG from the DPG  
And all the little kids looked up to him  
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him  
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel  
And all they hated on him because he was way to real  
I don't know why but he's just so fly  
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight

Man, but it sure was nice.  
You could dance all night if you felt all right,  
Drinking whiskey and throwing dice.

It was hard to leave.  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese.

She always dressed in red  
Wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance  
With a rag wrapped around her head.

Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you

You turned your eyes- plugged your up ears  
Ignored my cries  
Now Ms. America sayin' we scarin' her  
But she can give me Liberty or Death- I'm darin' her  
Either one'll set me free- that's all I want to be  
But that ain't what y'all want to see  
You'd rather see me killin' up my own in the ghetto  
Or sellin' blow to anybody Black, Brown, or Yellow  
But forget that- I'm tryin' to get my head right  
Even if it mean I gotta get dead tonight  
Lord have mercy forgive me  
[chorus]  
Forgive me for the blood that his body bled  
And all the tears that his Mommy shed  
Book says 'Thou Shalt Not Kill'  
But I done seen more blood spilled  
Than the vets on Hamburger Hill- it's real  
Post War Syndrome- went to see my homie  
But his Mama told me that the homie been gone  
Everytime I turn around it be another body on the ground  
With fresh gunshot wounds but he didn't hear a sound  
When he came out the room  
Nobody told him he would be dead so soon  
But the gauge went boom Ms. America,  
I know you got a cure for AIDS  
But we need a cure for Raid who on a rampage  
Can you feel it- the tensions in the air thick  
Hate got me so high I'm gettin' airsick  
Got my people broke lookin for a buck to borrow  
Doin it one day at a time fuck your sorrow  
Fuck tomorrow I want revenge  
I got a Beretta named Vendetta  
Time to answer for your sin- man  
When you meet your creator- tell him I apologize  
But I gotta ride Lord have mercy forgive me...

Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.  
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,  
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.  
  
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,  
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,  
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,  
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside.  
  
Cry like a child, though these years make me older,  
With children my time is so wastefully spent,  
A burden to keep, though their inner communion,  
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.  
  
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden,  
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,  
No words could explain, no actions determine,  
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.

I would look below.  
And see Mario  
Braving the ferocious dandelions  
  
Mario, our fearless superintendent  
Kept the garden green, despite the parkway smog  
But the flowering weeds  
Their fates decreed  
Pulled, to keep his rosebush from dying  
  
Then I would creep inside, curl up in my bed  
Something strong was pulling at my head  
Pulling at my heart  
  
Wild flower, growing in all the wrong places  
Wild flower, so lonely 'neath that lovely rose bush  
Proper garden's nightmare, queen of opened fields  
Tell me, who will love this wildflower  
For exactly what she is?  
  
Years passed by, we left that red brick building  
Left Mario behind  
For a brand new house  
But my dark brown skin  
On the white washed walls within  
Stood out, so it'd get me up and cryin'  
  
My growing pains had many rooms to fill, then  
Mother never knew  
She had a garden to keep clean  
While there was NY grease  
On her young flower from the Middle East  
She was busy pulling dendelions  
  
Then I would creep inside, curl up in my bed  
Something strong was pulling at my head  
Pulling at my heart

Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head

There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh)

Friends come together as we decorate the tree  
This is the time of year to live in harmony  
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep  
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh  
  
This is the holiday you're with the family  
We put aside our differences and let it be

Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle and another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rockaway rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me  
Stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway

This prisoner here before you is a social enemy  
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty

But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint  
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been  
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin  
  
We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes  
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones  
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well  
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell  
  
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how  
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now  
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then  
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men  
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done  
  
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son  
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands

With a lot of people staring  
With my feet on shaky ground  
And my head up in the sky  
But it's where I want to be  
It's a life that's made for caring  
Got a song to pass the day  
And a girl to share the night  
  
So if they ask you when I'm gone  
Was it everything he wanted?  
When he had to travel on  
Did he know he'd be missed?  
You can tell them this  
  
Hell yeah he did!  
He saw it all  
He walked the line  
Never had to crawl  
He cried a bit  
But not for long  
Hell yeah  
He found the life that he was after  
Filled it up with love and laughter  
Finally got it right  
And made it fit  
Hell yeah he did!  
Hell yeah he did!

Assuming roles from nursery rhymes  
Rested on the riverbank  
And grew up by and by, and grew up by and by  
  
Frail my heart apart  
And play me a little shady grove  
Ring the bells of rhymney

From the coast

Silently like ghosts

In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou  
Creeping along, singing a song, see'est, see'est bon, bon  
Playing the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro  
Having a duet with my coquette out on the bayou  
It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou  
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux  
Two more miles going wild to play my acoustic  
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music  
One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux  
While we's grooving, a fog was moving in on the bayou  
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough  
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux

He kissed the troubles from my brow  
I long to fall to sleep again  
And I wonder how he would look now  
  
Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?  
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?  
I like the way it feels but then  
I rarely dream of anyone  
  
In the songs of shame and the tales of dread  
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead  
And all the vines wind through their eyes  
Oh but no one knows this passion now

spent and I'm bent, I  
Don't remember yesterday at all, I'm barkin at the moon as I'm pissin' on the
wall, people grippin'  
New cars checkin' out a few bars, they see me comin' side step a few yards I'm
like a bad man, holdin'  
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin' an imaginary friend scary and I'm blackin'
out just about to lose  
All hope, I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin', and there
she was everything I  
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin'  
  
[Chorus]  
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl
and she shook it some  
More she's ruby. She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I
run right back I'm at it  
Again she's callin'  
  
I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle, carjacked a mini-van and punched
full throttle right back  
To the spot then I waited to get her, but when she came out, she had a bitch-
boy wit' her no problem,  
Hit the pipe and follow em' home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me
alone cause this really  
Goin' down I feel it pullin me home knowin I'm a wicked clown I gotta throw it
down, she pulled in her  
And her fuck ass strolled in, I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen,
jumpin through back yards  
Clumsey and trippin', it don't matter where ya go there's a throat slingin',
and the way she danced  
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games I'm on the side of her
house lookin in through  
The back den and there she was with him again dancin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I walk right in through the front door unlocked, no gun cocked, cinder block,
clown paint, I came  
Here to dance boogy, umph ahhh, and maybe tap a little nookie, I'm creepin
music bumpin in the back,  
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack, and here come the punk bout
to get champaighned, I  
Take the rock and pop em' with the damn thang, hit em' in the back of the
head, he dropped the wine  
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife, I washed
it off and put it back  
I'm keepin' the place nice I'm comin bitch you want an olive or somethin' I'm
fuckin' straight out the  
Streets but I'm down with some frontin' I want to tango, but instead I'm still
outside the club and it's  
All in my head.

groom  
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.  
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,  
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.  
  
Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her
dream  
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her,
dance little jean!  
  
They said:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant  
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had
spent.  
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little
jeanie's sake  
  
We played:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,

To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn  
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born  
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware  
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west

Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs  
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused  
  
Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way  
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say  
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand  
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste  
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest  
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold  
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold

know

I will educate you about Black people and we'll unite

And my game is unity

Trinity, unity  
  
My brothers have been chasing racists all the time  
Your brothers have been chasing freedom fighters all the time  
But at the end of the day  
We didn't know much about each other yeah  
  
When you saw a black man  
You saw a criminal,  
When I saw a white man  
I saw an oppressor  
But now that we know where we went wrong  
Let's unite  
  
You will educate me about white people  
I will educated you about black people  
  
That is why they call my trinity  
Cause my game is unity

You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled

With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick  
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked  
You don't like it but you still call him hunk  
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk  
You want to leave but Sonny started talking fast  
And it make you want to go and sell more ass  
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that

And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way

Are you the one getting played like a sucker?  
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?

He claims he wants to get something to eat  
But every day you find yourself getting beat  
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways

And almost get his ass hit for the crack

Have you ever been in a hot tub?

When I see the boy pinned to your earlobe  
He's talking shit and you crack a smile  
When he tell you that he can go buck wild  
For a girl like you and make it feel good  
You know it's drama but it sound real good  
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""  
The pussy so he can keep bragging  
You want to do it but you feeling like a H-O-E  
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over

Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay  
They are gonna get all the play

Unlike Iceberg Slimm

There was something strange, I could not look away  
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go  
  
You gave me no warning  
You gave no reason  
But I was with you  
Right by your side  
Just give me the strength, and I will help you  
And they can try their hardest, 'cause they don't frighten me

It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't  
know why  
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm  
Then I really believe, you could make it right  
  
Ooh the time has come now  
We must show our feelings  
But I'm looking right through you  
And your heart is empty  
  
Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now  
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide  
Ah you let me down!  
  
But wait a minute, I don't understand  
It's getting stronger, so grab my hand  
Don't want to leave you, don't want to go  
But I'm losing all control  
Can't you see me? I'm slipping away  
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here

Oh so many times since I've read those words  
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?

There forever, never put out to pasture

Bringing peace to all

Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain  
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire

Grey morning will never divide us

He was an early morning eagle flying through from the fire  
Barely getting over forget getting by

Polly and her pity wasn't pretty at all  
She concentrated fully on the shine of the star  
But your pennies, just a pension  
She never let go  
They always dominated everything that she owned  
She couldn't stop to see, she didn't have the time  
How could she afford to pay attention to life?  
Oh it's all the same for Polly the Vain  
If she had to do it over she would do it the same

Are you all right darling, all right now?  
You'll never be, never be the same.  
Are you all right darling, all right now?  
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?  
  
You didn't see it coming  
That's the tale of his life  
Easy operator laid to rest in the night  
He had to take the hit it's always the same  
That's the waste you see in killing Billy Kincade

Let it breathe into us and put you back in place  
Let it breathe, let it breathe  
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave  
For it will, it will go  
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello  
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass  
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass

Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk  
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk  
When we're too tired to talk  
  
And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was  
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off  
Let it rot, let it rot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
In a knot, in a knot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got  
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'

Across the land

And all for no reason

High up in the chair  
Explain to the court room  
What went through your mind  
And we'll ask the jury  
What verdict they find

Of death over life

I widowed his wife  
I begged their forgiveness

Crossing the plain  
  
And he'd come to fetch me  
To see what they'd done  
And we'll ride together  
To kingdom come

Like a bat out of hell  
Like a fish out of water  
I'm scared, can't you tell  
  
Bang Bang  
Put my gun down on the table  
Before you try to blow my mind  
I used to think it was you  
Who was so unstable  
But now I'm sure I'm close behind  
  
B-B-Bang  
B-B-Bang Bang Boom  
  
I thought you were good  
You painted me bad  
Compared to the others  
The best thing I had  
But then I discovered  
It couldn't get worse  
You're buildin' my coffin  
You're drivin' the hearse  
I thought it was you  
I loved you the most  
But I was just keepin'  
My enemies close  
I made a decision I had to employ  
So how did you end up with all of my toys  
  
I'm not your brother, not your lover  
And I'm not your friend  
Now that it's over you're another  
Kind of different  
A new person  
Your time is up  
And that's my blood in your dixie cup

will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is
Jesus.

Lives next door to the cemetery  
How many lovers have you buried  
We would shout running scared  
Along the green and golden paths  
That took us home away from Crazy Mary  
  
In the lamplight burning low  
Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...  
  
So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary

The kind of love  
Keats and Shelley would be jealous of  
And it's you baby  
You made it all come true baby

Undying admiration  
Undying admiration

And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration

Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door  
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore

Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful  
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced  
I motivate and await my sober state

Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual  
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual  
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know how he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic in  
That ol' silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around, oh  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say, he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away  
  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin', Catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or  
  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin', Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day  
  
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump

What a Life  
  
Back to nature boys, Vasser girls too  
Watch what you say, or think, or do  
Continental-style strasse girls might  
But you know exactly if it's wrong or right  
Education is an important key, yes  
But the good life's never won by degrees, no  
  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale  
Only window shopping, it's strictly no sale  
Week end starts Friday soon after eight  
Your jet black magic helps you celebrate  
You may be stranded if you stick around  
And that's really something

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name  
  
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boy-meant  
Fall in love and you won't regret it  
That's the best work of all, if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
?neath a starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Strolling with the one girl  
Sighing sigh after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone  
Waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Loving one who loves you  
And then taking that vow  
It?s nice work if you can get it  
And if you get it, won?t you tell me how?

We'll spend the whole day weeping  
Right now I want you to lay down your weary head

feeling like you're one inch tall  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
You're way too hard on yourself baby  
You got some pretty basic things wrong  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you why I wrote you into this song  
You're looking at your heart baby, and you're calling it black  
But like Icarus and like Saul  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Now I know this hurt you're feeling  
I've felt these same things too  
I've got spaces way down deep inside of me that are just the same as you  
You want to wrap your arms around your head, turn out the lights  
And roll yourself into a ball  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Are you blinded by the brilliance?  
Are you dazzled by the Light?  
Why is it I see nothing but emptiness in your tired beaten eyes  
That once were bright  
I know you just can't help but run when you hear that sweet voice call  
You got too close to heaven, that's all

From the trestle you could hear the weirdest moans  
With a mighty lonesome cry came a whistle from the sky  
And it chilled the very marrow in my bones  
  
Then a loud rushing roar like you never heard before  
Turned the blood to icy water in my veins  
As I watched with rising fear something strange was drawing near  
And I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
  
(Ghost trains ghost trains what a fearful sight)  
The Cannonball and No 9 were racing through the night  
Just as they passed me by I heard the engineer cry  
Giver her coal give her coal shovel it on  
  
You could see the fireman grinnin' in the engine that was winnin'  
But I knew before the finish they'd be gone  
(Well he knew before the finish they'd be gone)  
You could see the drivers roll as they shoveled on the coal  
  
And the black smoke came pouring from the stacks  
As they thundered through the sky I am here to testify  
You could hear the wheel a clickin' on the tracks  
Through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam  
  
Now I have no proof but still the fact remains  
You may doubt it but I swear there were cinders in my hair  
When I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
(Ghost trains ghost trains...  
  
As I watched I saw them fade into the dawn  
(As he watched he saw them fade into the dawn)

She never thought about the future, she just did what she would  
Oh but she really cared  
About her music, it all seemed so important then,  
  
And she dreamed that every time that she performed  
Everyone would cry for more,  
That all she had to do was step into the light,  
And everyone would start to roar.  
  
And on the road,  
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,  
She battled through  
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.  
  
But now every time that she performed  
Oh everybody cried for more,  
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,  
For everyone to start to roar.  
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.  
  
Oh but time went by  
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.  
Yes times were hard,  
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.  
  
An then there was the time that she performed  
When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light,  
They really let her know the score.  
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs  
And everybody cried for more,  
When all she had to do was step into the light  
For everyone to start to roar.

Especially when I see you're not around  
  
There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic  
in Latin, Greek or Spic  
There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander  
dishing all their tricks

There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying ""I Blow""  
she's with the ""jive five 2 plus 3""  
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates  
or else doing it for free  
  
The past keeps knock, knock, knocking on my door  
And I don't want to hear it anymore  
  
No consolations please for feelin' funky

Waiting on his hands and knees  
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly  
  
Moved by desire and fear  
He takes a few steps away  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
And she listens openly  
  
He pours his soul into the water  
Reflecting the mystery  
She carries him away  
And the winds die slowly  
  
And she listens openly  
And she listens openly  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean

It's time we said goodbye  
Bury your head and silence your cry  
Know the feel of pain  
Join our world and play our game  
  
Without you they'll never know  
Without you my life won't grow  
Without you they'll never show  
Without you the night won't go  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you my life's a waste  
Just for you I wrap my face  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you I live in pain  
Without you I've gone insane

Don't ever take my dignity (x4)  
Whatever you may do to me  
Don't crucify my dignity

And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down  
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend  
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,  
To welcome death  
  
For I received a letter that is worth reporting  
And though it may raise a cynical smile  
It leaves a sinking feeling  
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...  
""Have you seen my pride and joy?...""  
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...  
""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.  
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet  
And I was thinking if something you said...""  
  
""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.  
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college  
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive  
I imagine I may think again...""  
  
""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack  
Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have  
Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask  
I don't know why I am writing to you""

Five minutes maybe 10  
Can't wait to see you again and again

Hell baby I almost danced  
Caught myself close to believing  
But every time is a brand new feeling  
Lay me down in cool clear water

Still I know where this is leading

Won once and once refused  
Already burning down the fuse  
Don't wanna be building walls  
Cause everything rising falls  
It's darkness here the light's concealing  
Love it seems is too revealing  
Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving

Til you find it's only hollow

Was that your cue?

But not enough for two

I met a good old friend of mine

Bring yourself and a bottle of wine""

Something I'd never seen  
Some satisfaction  
Dancin' alone

There's a white house in Georgia  
Down the Mason-Dixon line  
They got Kentucky Derby winners there  
They got a Lear jet parked outside  
Yeah but every Friday weekend  
When the big tom cat's away  
You'll find the plantation shakin'  
By the butler and the upstairs maid  
Don't need no money, diamonds or cadillacs  
To get all the satisfaction dancin' alone

Don't you worry  
'bout the problems of the human race  
Get some satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone baby

At a hot spot in Texas  
On an endless Friday night  
I was listenin' to Waylon and Willie  
When a cowgirl passed my sights  
And I took a look in the mirror  
To make sure that my head was screwed on  
I was feeling rejected  
But I wasn't going home  
In a moment of a rash decision  
I threw myself right on the floor  
I did a backflip and somersault  
Yeah, the crowd called for more  
So if you're tired of watching  
Being left on the shelf  
Get your satisfaction dancin' alone

Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel  
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods  
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold  
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.  
  
When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.  
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion,  
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back  
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.  
  
But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,  
And somewhere in between I must have grown  
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.  
  
Now I know, it's a long hard road  
  
Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,  
When the sun-up came, we got up and went  
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent  
Singin' songs along with gramma's radio.  
  
Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,  
Livin' in my memories all in vain  
'cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like  
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.  
  
Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,  
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.  
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'  
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.  
  
Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road  
Yes, I know, it's a long hard road.

Was slipping on the tears from the day  
When I was young and brave  
Now all these hotel lobbies are filled with what's to me  
Lonely midnight drivers  
Drifting out to sea  
And all those late night lovers  
Don't make things better to me  
  
So let it roll into me  
Let it roll into you  
Let it roll into me  
Let it roll back into when I had you  
  
So I'll watch the snow come calling  
And I'll celebrate the spring  
I'll feel the falls keep falling

Walls close in on me.  
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.  
Severe anguish as my body evolves.  
The pain of life after death it resolves.  
  
Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,  
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.  
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.  
Merely secret in my dreams.  
  
Night grows cold, twilight's near,  
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.  
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass  
No spared breath.  
  
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.  
Dead soul,  
Stone cold,  
Out into the night.  
  
Voices inside my head  
Hold me under.  
Voices oppress.  
Like roaring thunder.  
  
An echo bouncing inside my brain.  
How much can I take of the pain,  
The pain!  
  
A war raging deep inside my head,  
A split decision that will end with me dead.  
  
You see the agony in my eyes,  
Protruding aimless,  
I think it's time to die.  
  
A cannibal's desire feeds the fire  
That burns in your head.  
  
Intense pain eats away at your brain,  
Thorazine pumping through your veins.  
  
Death walks inside you,  
Smell death around you,  
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,  
Hear the sound of the bell  
Counting off death tolls.  
  
Laughing as you eternally rot,  
Searching for human flesh  
And life's blood.

And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money  
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine  
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me  
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again

And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain

Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain  
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine  
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start  
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain  
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all  
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine  
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain  
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain  
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine

Black clouds are moving in, a storm is coming on  
Inside the confessional, Angel and I are playing games  
I'm acting the priest, and she is the sinner of all my dreams...  
Dreams, dreams, turn into a nightmare  
A sudden change on her face, her smile is gone without a trace  
""Nothing... nothing is forever"", she said  
""So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear  
A year ago... I signed a sacred pact, and if you love me so will you""  
Then she told me of the Pact, her tears were not an act  
And they were not alone, all my dreams... shattered to the bone  
I fell to my knees in prayer... but ohhh this is Hell  
The Pact is so powerful, it leaves you no way out  
Unless within a year, someone else will sign it in blood  
Someone to take your place, to guard this evil church  
Another wolf to roam the hills, another wolf... in for the kill  
""Nothing... nothing is forever"", she said  
""So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear  
A year ago... I signed a sacred Pact""  
If i sign it now, Angel will be free to go  
She must leave without her memory, no more a wolf, but as a lady  
And if I don't, then in seven days she will die before my very eyes  
Either way... I'll never see her again  
If i sign then I must stay, and only leave as a wolf for prey  
""Nothing... nothing is forever"", she said  
""So many things are wrong in here, so many times I've lived in fear

Lies the seed that with the sun's love,

They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.  
  
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him That's what they did.

Whenever your airplane happens to land  
Maybe I'll be back here too  
It all depends on what's with you.  
  
Woke up waiting for a windy day  
Cat on I ? since the first of February  
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow  
But standing here I say I just don't know.  
  
New ones come in as the old ones go  
Everything's moving here but much too slowly  
A little bit quicker and we might have time  
To say how do you do before we left behind.  
  
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo  
The very last lately inquired about you  
It's really very one or two  
The first you wanted the last I knew.  
  
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel  
Less concerned about the people unreal  
The very first word is how do you do  
The last go home your mama's calling you.  
  
Calling you oh, oh, oh, oh, h,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh,  
Calling you oh, oh, oh

And took a step outside  
  
Once I knew all the tales

Follow the pale moonlight  
Once I wished for this night  
Faith brought me here  
It's time to cut the rope and fly

Far across the sea  
All the burdens gone  
Open the chest once more  
Dark chest of wonders  
Seen through the eyes  
Of the one with pure heart

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me  
This night will bring him back to me

Steady rolling through the warning signs  
That were hidden in between the lines  
That kept us rocking till the break of day

We used to take about a day and a night  
To try to sing up all the soul in sight  
And anyone who couldn't see the light  
We had to leave behind  
And the sweetest thing you ever heard  
Was the singing of the speckled bird  
And commercial was a dirty word  
We laid it on the line

To try to chase away the black and blues  
And when it came the time to pay your dues  
You gave an I.O.U.  
To the devil with the dirty smile  
Which he added to the growing pile  
Of the promises you mean to keep  
The day your dreams come true

And you like my thoughts are borne off by the wind

My shit'll have you runnin' naked like in old school  
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it and you ain't ridin' on me  
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army  
And I'm a rider homie

And times have been so tough, that I can't tell you  
What can you say to accuse me  
When you know I'm not to blame  
You know you're gonna use me

For the criminal minded  
As for years they have killed one another of  
And America has enjoyed its creation  
But now these ghetto-minded criminals  
Have crossed the line into your neighborhood  
And will soon give you a taste of the hell  
That they have lived for so long  
So pops, this time its your son gets shot  
Deal with your own creation  
Well, I've been to the storm house and then some  
Payed me dues but I'm still a street hoodlum  
Dropped out of school 'cause I couldn't find my locker  
Stubbles on my chin, I got hair like Chewbacca  
Might see me sleeping on the street  
Don't look for a job 'cause there's no jobs looking for me  
Then it all went to my head  
Next, forty-nine motherfuckers dead  
Tell the pigs I did it  
Place spot at your back  
And beat you in the head with it  
And keep your bitch in place  
Or I'm a send her ass home with a foot print on her face  
Uh, I'm hating sluts  
Shoot them in the face, steb back and itch my nuts  
'Less I'm in the sac  
'cause I fuck so hard it'll break they back  
All the pressure's packed into one nut  
I was waiting on a bus and my head blew up  
And the sight'll make ya sick

Psychopathic  
Thought you know bitch  
The ICP is made up of psychotic  
Demented psycho clumsy motherfuckers  
And we'll put a hook on your bumb leg  
Like it ain't nobody's business  
So I'm standing by the train tracks  
Then you see me running but naked with a battle axe  
I'm swinging and slicing and chopping and cutting and..  
Aah, until I'm nothing  
Seems like I always get beat down  
Like the hawk turned to the wicked clown  
Tail turned out to the ghetto 'cause  
Southwest Detriot is comended one's home  
So you might see me at a festival  
Cussin', rude, and scratching my testicles  
With a cold two-liter in hand  
Rapping to the bitch at the french fry stand  
Take it to the Patent Park  
Then I'll make a sexist remark  
'cause they're all eventually bitching  
Serve me fucking take your ass to the kitchen  
Police don't like me it's obvious  
Just don't look in the trunk  
Or the sight'll make you sick  
Violent J, motherfucker, psychopathic  
(theme from ""Halloween"")  
Yeah, I've always been a psycho  
Psycho-psycho-sick-psycho-sick-psycho-psycho  
I'll throw rocks at stray dogs  
Build crackhouses out of Lincoln logs  
I cut class, said I was a faker  
You was in school, I was home watching Green Acres  
Now I'm all up in your face  
You can barely hear the rap with all that bass  
I'm running with a southwest street gang  
And I never let my southwest meat hang  
'cause you know what ICP's all about  
Take a brick off the street  
And bust you in the mouth  
Find the girl's daddy's rich  
And his sweet little angel's my sewer freak bitch  
But I filled the turkey up with the stuffing  
Like Billy Bill say, ""a bitch ain't nothing""  
Grab her by the arm and break  
Grab her by the life and take it  
And, ya know, the sight'll make ya sick

I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
We fought in a battle, nobody won  
now we face A mountain to be overcome  
You can't run away, the past is said and done  
I need us to carry on  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
You'll try everything  
You never thought would work before  
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all  
You can always give up some more  
  
Baby nothing means anything  
Unless you're here to share with me  
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep  
Cause you're always there in my dreams  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again

Baby Girl where you at ?  
  
[Lil Mo]  
Right here  
Right here  
right here baby  
Here's another one  
  
[Fabolous]  
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself  
Won't nobody do as much as myself  
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself  
For a pretty girl as such as yaself  
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself  
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself  
But I, make the time when I have to  
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women  
There's some who be willing and skimming  
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in  
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens  
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now  
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous  
Others pass diseases that you can catch now  
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world  
And.. I don't want to live in it alone  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: Lil Mo]  
Ill give you all my love  
And you can always trust  
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)  
Ill never leave (no, no, no)  
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me  
So holla at somebody real (cause i)  
'cause I'm so real  
  
[Fabolous]  
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92  
but I pray I will find you  
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you  
The fake may try to blind you  
That's why I stay fly like I do  
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to  
First I need a girl that may die as my boo  
Then I may try the I do's  
But, I refuse to be trick  
Or used by a chick  
Who gets amusement of kicks  
Out of abusing my dick  
When its real I'm all in it  
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it  
(no) before it didn't matter who  
Now I look for some with a little attitude  
I could chitter chatter to, good looking  
But witty and compatible  
Long hair wit a fatty too  
And that'll do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lil Mo]  
No I'm not trying to pressure you  
But my loves to incredible  
For to waste  
In front of your face  
Then I give you something you can feel  
To let you know your hollering at somebody real  
  
[Fabolous]  
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you  
The feelings that I feel could that be true  
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo  
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away  
That's til somebody real sways my way  
Then I might spend some days always  
On a Asia bay  
Eating food made the Cajun way  
And sippin ga lil saki  
Blowing a lil brocoli  
But this world is full of fluzi's  
And bullshit usually  
I pull I'm choosy  
And on this joint and at this point  
I know I need to holla at somebody real  
For real

What is right, what is wrong for our people  
Time has run out for all those who wait  
With bent limbs and minds that are feeble  
  
And the rain falls and blows through their window  
And the snow falls and blows through their door  
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  
When the tides rise, they cover the floor  
  
And they come from the north  
And they come from the south  
And they come from the hills and they valleys  
And they're migrants and farmers  
And miners and humans  
Our census neglected to tally  
  
And the rain falls and blows through their window  
And the snow falls and blows through their door  
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  
When the tides rise, they cover the floor  
  
And they're African, Mexican, Caucasian, Indian  
Hungry and hopeless Americans  
The orphans of wealth and of adequate health  
Disowned by this nation they live in  
  
And with weather-worn hands  
On bread lines they stand  
Yet but one more degradation  
Yes, and they're treated like tramps  
While we sell them food stamps  
This thriving and prosperous nation  
  
And the rain falls and blows through their window  
And the snow falls and blows through their door  
And the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  
When the tides rise, they cover the floor  
  
And with roaches and rickets and rats in the thickets  
Infested, diseased, and decaying  
With rags and no shoes and skin sores that ooze  
By the poisonous pools they are playing  
  
In shacks of two rooms that are rotting wood tombs  
With corpses breathing inside them  
Yes, and we pity their plight as they call in the night  
And we do all that we can do to

About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder  
After all has been said and is done for  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone  
  
Is this life just a path  
To the place that we all have come from  
Does the heart know the way  
And if not can it ever be found  
In a smile or a tear  
Or a prayer or a sigh or a song  
  
And if so I sing for my father  
And in truth you must know I would rather  
He were here by my side  
We could fly on the wings of a dream  
To a place where the spirit could find us  
And joy and surrender would bind us  
We are one anyway  
Anyway we are more than we seem  
  
There are those who will lead us  
Protect us each step of the way  
From beginning to end  
For each moment forever each day  
Such a gift has been given  
It can never be taken away  
  
Though the body in passing must leave us  
There is one who remains to receive us  
There are those in this life  
Who are friends from our heavenly home  
So I listen to the voices inside me  
For I know they are there just to guide me  
And my faith will proclaim it is so  
We are never alone  
  
From the life to the light  
From the dark of the night to the dawn  
He is so in my heart  
He is here he could never be gone  
Though the singer is silent  
There still is the truth of the song  
  
Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder

And I'll be there again  
I don't have any answers my friend  
Just this pile of old questions  
My memory left me here  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
I'm going' back to my house  
But I'm not goin' now  
It's too early to be leaving here, somehow  
Let me bore you with this story  
""How my lover let me down""  
While I borrow seeds of sadness  
From the ground.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
When I'm all done cultivatin'  
I'll be rockin' on the porch  
Tryin' to picture you and where you are  
And there'll be no hesitatin'  
When Cupid lights the torch  
With those headlights comin' down the hill  
Between the stars.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend

Until it crashes unto the earth

Will undo the stopper

And I didn't feel like very much.  
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy,  
Where is your famous golden touch?""  
I thought you knew where  
All of the elephants lie down,  
I thought you were the crown prince  
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town.  
  
Just take a look at your body now,  
There's nothing much to save  
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries,  
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""  
  
Now if you can manage to get  
Your trembling fingers to behave,  
Why don't you try unwrapping  
A stainless steel razor blade?  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
There's no hot water  
And the cold is running thin.  
Well, what do you expect from  
The kind of places you've been living in?  
  
Don't drink from that cup,  
It's all caked and cracked along the rim.  
That's not the electric light, my friend,  
That is your vision growing dim.  
  
Cover up your face with soap, there,  
Now you're Santa Claus.  
And you've got a gift for anyone  
Who will give you his applause.  
  
I thought you were a racing man,  
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace.  
That's a funeral in the mirror  
And it's stopping at your face.  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Ah wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair,  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman,  
Oh, there were times she was just a child,  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild.  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view,  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you.  
That's a hard one to remember,  
Yes it makes you clench your fist.  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways,  
All along your wrist.  
And yes it's come to this,  
It's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
You can still find a job,  
Go out and talk to a friend.  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send.  
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,  
They can give you back your hope,  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope.  
  
But you've used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams.  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward,  
That's a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan,  
The stand in stunt man,

It's just the dress rehearsal rag,  
You know this dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just a dress rehearsal rag.

Just to feel the danger  
I want to scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breathe?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.  
  
Let down your defenses  
Use no common sense  
If you look you will see  
That this world is a beautiful  
Accident turbulent succulent  
Opulent permanent, no way  
I want to taste it  
Don't want to waste it away  
  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh my self to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.

And find it gone

From Germany and Europe  
And Southern U.S.A.  
They made this little town here  
That we live in to this day  
  
The children of the white man  
Saw Indians on TV  
And heard about the legend  
How their city was a dream

And find it gone

And World War One and Two  
If we can live together  
The dream it might come true

The dream is still alive

A world that never dies

End up with the poison in their blood  
  
He did what he had to do for the money  
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare  
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho  
And jeans like the gavachos wear

A big car come fast down the boulevard  
Spider stood caught in its headlights  
Got hit and went down hard

Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass

Put the childhood dream to the test  
Find the measure of the man  
Follow the sun heading west

Slapping patches up out your hair, better say better somebody to find  
Straight up and down and rap flawn, these jackers ain't on  
That's why I skip the slab, and I move straight to foreign  
Everybody has collided with The Screwed Up Click  
And when I pick up the mic and I go off, they say how he do that shit  
I'm a mic wrecker, about to checkmate like checkers  
A pine breasher, with 25 bags of light green on my dresser

Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn

Gripping grain on the feeter, switching lanes with Aaliyah  
Top down low to the ground, car looking completed  
Balling hard like Kobe, put two inches on tobe  
Pack a seventeen shot, hope a nigga don't provoke me  
Cars they smoking, with herbal incent  
Mashing horses flipping tortoise, candy up like sip  
Beat the toll for a dolla, as I smash right under  
On the passenger of me, riding underground under  
I ponder in the game, passing laws gripping grain  
Screens fall like rain, leaving puddles and stains  
For my grind be major, hit me on two way pager  
All my tools there's a later, for a safe place hater  
So when you see me in them streets, you best bow down  
I'm gripping grain causing pain, hold it down H-Town  
Like a king or a chief, I'm blowing endo sweets  
Saving my change pushing my Range, starched up looking sweet

Got a beach house in Galveston, with woofers on bump  
And we gon choke on smoke, and swallow drank as we sail  
Atlantic Ocean the Pacific, man I'm making my mail  
From selling yale to record sales, to fatten our pocket  
Murdering motherfuckers on wax, can't nobody can stop it  
With the checks and a black X, and a rolex make niggas check  
Got my nose wide open, smelling nothing but plex  
I get deep like a dimple, complicated but simple  
From rags to riches on these bitches, Screwed Up medallion with a symbol  
Ain't no mo' chains and pieces, for my nephews and nieces  
When the record stores get empty, my ass get money increases  
You can't walk on my lawn, better leave my Vipor alone  
Got a house in Sweet Water Texas, Lexus and a pond with a swan  
They call me a swanga not a diss, I broke up on and made her bitch  
Now affiliated on a candy coated yacht, eating on shrimp fish

Bringing movement, bringing life

Thrown away  
Disappearing in the air

Saving the world on his own  
Warm summer breezes, French wine and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
The summers and winters scattered like splinters  
And four or five years slipped away  
  
He went to England, played the piano, and married  
An actress named Kim  
They had a good life, she was a good wife  
And bore him a young son named Jim  
All of the answers and all of the questions  
He locked in his attic one day  
Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'  
And twenty more years slipped away  
  
War took his baby,  
Bombs killed his lady and left him  
With only one eye  
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered  
All he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling he was recalling  
Answers that he never found  
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound  
  
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinks  
His Green label each day  
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing

To the things I learned so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games to only pass the time  
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
Now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
  
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide  
But every day can be a magic carpet ride  
A little bit of courage is all we lack  
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

Tie a rope around his waist,  
throw him in the swamp

They raised up a son that could  
eat up his weight in groceries  
Named him after a man of the cloth.  
They called him Amos Moses  
  
Now folks in South Louisiana  
said Amos was a helluva man  
He could trap the biggest, meanest alligator.  
He only had to use one hand  
That's all he got left  
'cause the alligator bit him. Ha ha!

Expecting to fly.  
While I laughed, I wondered whether  
I could wave goodbye,  
Knowin' that you'd gone.  
By the summer it was healing,  
We had said goodbye.  
All the years we'd spent with feeling  
Ended with a cry,  
Babe, ended with a cry,  
Babe, ended with a cry.  
  
I tried so hard to stand  
As I stumbled and fell to the ground.  
So hard to laugh as I fumbled  
And reached for the love I found,  
Knowin' it was gone.  
If I never lived without you,  
Now you know I'd die.  
If I never said I loved you,  
Now you know I'd try,

Long before these crowded streets  
Here stood my dreaming tree

What forever took to find  
And now he's falling hard  
He feels the falling dark  
How he longs to be  
Beneath his dreaming tree  
Conquered fear to climb  
A moment froze in time  
When the girl who first he kissed  
Promised him she'd be his  
Remembered mother's words  
There beneath the tree

Easy up 'til then  
For sure she'd make the grade  
Adorers came in hordes  
To lay down in her wake  
She gave it all she had  
But treasures slowly fade  
Now she's falling hard  
She feels the fall of dark  
How did this fall apart  
She drinks to fill it up  
A smile of sweetest flowers  
Wilted so and soured  
Black tears stain the cheeks  
That once were so admired  
She thinks when she was small  
There on her father's knee  
How he had promised her  
You'll always be my baby  
Daddy come quick

I can't find my way home  
There is no place to hide

Does it really matter whose to blame

Now I never call at all  
Knowing you could only call me names

I know what the cards say  
Sometimes the hard way  
It looks so easy

You turn that knob  
Or flip that switch  
Something I shouldn't do  
Why you already knew  
Thats all been taught to me

And thats just enough to understand  
That the more I know  
The more I'm sure

And I'm dead and gone  
Let em put it on my tombstone  
He knew just enough to get in trouble  
But not enough to leave it alone  
  
They got a book somewhere  
On everything a woman wants  
Bout how and when and where  
And why they will  
And why they won't  
Thats complicated stuff  
And when it comes to love  
I'm still learning

Waylon always told me  
Son everybody makes mistakes  
And how come it's always me  
Standing there when something breaks  
  
Yeah I know just enough to get in trouble  
And thats just enough to understand  
That the more I know  
The more I'm sure  
Someday it's gonna do me in  
Yeah when my time comes  
And I'm dead and gone  
Let em write it on my tombstone  
Here lies just enough to get in trouble  
But not enough to leave it alone

Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside  
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need  
Chase this with a little lust and greed

Sounds like love but you know it won't last  
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit  
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route  
Red velvet walls  
Line the sugar-coated halls  
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls  
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes  
It's too late I already cut the brakes  
  
I'm rollin', strollin' into town  
Is it me or am I going crazy?  
This dirty city is my sugar town  
My little angel of death is my nightlife  
  
You better make a move before I get bored  
If you wanna explore my vocal chord  
Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch  
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch  
Why don't you stick around for one more round?  
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown  
'Cause I'm a ring leader  
I run the show  
And only when I tell ya  
Will it be time to go

Steps inside a candy store  
Reds are sweet and greens are sour  
Still no letter at her door  
So she'll wash her flower curtains  
Hang them in the wind to dry  
Dust her tables with his shirt and  
Wave another day goodbye  
  
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber  
Marcie's sorrow needs a man  
Red is autumn green is summer  
Greens are turning and the sand  
All along the ocean beaches  
Stares up empty at the sky  
Marcie buys a bag of peaches  
Stops a postman passing by  
And summer goes  
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper  
Winter blows  
Up from the river there's no one to take her  
To the sea  
  
Marcie dresses warm its snowing  
Takes a yellow cab uptown  
Red is stop and green's for going  
Sees a show and rides back down  
Down along the Hudson River  
Past the shipyards in the cold  
Still no letter's been delivered  
Still the winter days unfold  
Like magazines  
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars  
Make a dream  
Dream back to summer and hear how  
He tells her  
Wait for me  
  
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us  
Where or why she moved away  
Red is angry green is jealous  
That was all she had to say  
Someone thought they saw her Sunday  
Window shopping in the rain  
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket  
And went west again

In pain and desperation  
Her aching limbs and downcast face  
Aglow with perspiration  
  
Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire  
With just the briefest pause  
The flooding through her memory  
The echoes of old applause

And closes her bedroom door

Defies the empty page  
His beard is white, his face is lined  
And streaked with tears of rage  
  
Thirty years ago, how the words would flow  
With passion and precision  
But now his mind is dark and dulled  
By sickness and indecision  
And he stares out the kitchen door  
Where the sun will rise no more

To live their fantasies  
But most of us just dream about

But the time isn't right and there's things to be done  
And you're trapped half-way up, you don't want to go back  
So you keep going on - compromising the lack  
  
And you see the green fields as you travel on by  
And you look at the things you'd forgotten to try  
And you wish you were young and you wish you were old  
For the songs always sung and the stories been told  
  
And you thought you were different but what did it mean  
For you tricked yourself trying - life's still unseen  
As it is, as it was, as it always will be  
Will you find out at all what it is to be free  
  
See it never was easy to live with a head  
So I kept to the back room and I live there instead  
What comes from the front-room is only for ""Friends""  
I have a bay window but that's where it ends  
  
And it's here I see pictures and my madness is clear  
And there's no longer logic so therefore no fear  
And I'm almost dead with uncontrollable light  
Sometimes when I've written a song - it's alright...

Leading me into solitude arms

And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn

That all angels will greet with an envious song  
One look into strangers eyes  
And I know where I belong

Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time would've passed us by  
  
Oh I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But I'll carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn

All the lights in the world went black  
He felt like a tiger in a burning tree  
It was like he was late for something  
That he did not wanna see  
His life looks better on paper  
He lives like a tiger in a burning tree  
  
Blow out the candles and make a wish  
  
A woman from the city in the South  
She lost her cow when the bottom fell out  
She sold her life to the deep blue sea  
She left a message for the world to see  
She knows better what it's like to be  
A tiger in a burning tree  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Blow out the candles and look away  
  
I was a child that painted my toys angel blue and devil red  
I broke him into pieces, set them on fire  
Swept him under my bed  
I never learned how to play nice with all the other kids  
I never learned how to draw inside the lines and probably never will  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Imagine a world so much better than this  
Now close your eyes and jump to a place you attain to be  
And you can tell me what it feels like  
To be a tiger in a burning tree

I read her diary it's the same story and nothing better,  
The words remind me of someone else's heart  
Has gone and left a mark.  
And the pop music plays  
On the local radio,  
There's people on the streets but no one that I know  
And like my heart is now  
I know not where they go.  
  
Same words different meaning  
Same heart different feeling,  
So much for him so much for her 'cause that's past,  
Now I know about that someone else's heart.  
  
She got nosy and read my letters too  
And my notebook surprised to find that  
Love is not so new,  
So we both took  
Someone else's heart  
And walked it through the dark.  
  
A feeling so rich  
I turned around to laugh,  
We had both indulged in each other's past  
To find out that our love  
Was true enough to last.

Maybe I dream too much  
But when I think of you  
I long to feel your touch  
To whisper in your ear  
Words that are old as time  
Words only you would hear  
If only you were mine  
  
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you  
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes  
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do  
And you'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me too  
These three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
Until the end of time  
  
So today I finally find the courage deep inside  
Just to walk right up to your door  
But my body can't move when I finally get to it  
Like a thousand times before  
Then without a word you handed me this letter  
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me too  
Until the end of time  
  
Well maybe I, I need a little love, yeah  
Maybe I, I need a little care  
Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you  
If you do, Just reach out, I'll be there  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me  
Please say you love me too  
These three words, they could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together

If you had  
One shot,  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip?  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti  
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'  
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out  
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now  
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!  
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity  
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked  
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes  
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke  
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's
when its  
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment  
You own it, you better never let it go  
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order  
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to  
Five and I can't provide the right type of  
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers  
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna,  
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not  
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's
lot  
So here I go is my shot.  
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

When I saw the ambulance in the road

Will the crowd disperse

And the wind that follows after  
For one certain face  
And an unforgotten laughter  
I've been following signs  
I've been searching through the lands  
For a certain pair of arms  
And a certain pair of hands  
Yes, I tried a kiss here  
And I tried a kiss there  
For when you're out in company  
The boys and girls will pair  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
An occasional sunset reminded me  
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree  
Or one red star hung low in the west  
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest  
Made me think for a moment  
Maybe its true  
I found him in the star  
In the call  
In the blue  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
Anywhere, anywhere you

But seasons, change and lovers too  
And winter's twice as cold  
But the fire in one heart is always burning  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain  
And what was love is just a spell that's broken  
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do  
Seems our hearts have never really spoken

Soda Pop and Ritalin

Sins in hell  
As far as I can tell  
At least the ones that I got away with  
  
And there's nothing wrong with me

Sitting on my crucifix  
The living room in my private womb  
While the Moms and brats are away

To keep me insane  
Doing someone else's cocaine

It says home is where your heart is  
But what a shame  
Cause everyone's heart  
Doesn't beat the same  
It's beating out of time

City of the damned

In the bathroom stall  
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall  
And so it seemed to confess  
  
It didn't say much

The center of the earth  
Is the end of the world

Born and raised by hypocrites  
Hearts recycled but never saved  
From the cradle to the grave

From Anaheim to the Middle East  
We are the stories and disciples of  
The Jesus of suburbia

Are we demented or am I disturbed?

Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed  
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused  
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse  
  
To live, and not to breathe  
Is to die, in tragedy  
To run, to run away  
To find, what you believe  
  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
I lost my faith to this  
This town that don't exist  
So I run, I run away  
To the lights of masochists  
  
And I, leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
And I, walked this line  
A million and one fucking times  
But not this time  
  
I don't feel any shame  
I wont apologize  
When there ain't nowhere you can go  
Running away from pain  
When you've been victimized  
Tales from another broken home  
  
Oh you're leaving

A light mist in the air  
Dark clouds laughing at me in silence  
Casting shadows through my hair  
  
In the distance I saw a woman  
Dressed in black with eyes of grey  
She wore her pain like a shackled spirit  
Eternal life was her debt to pay  
  
The lady wore black  
It's the sign of the prisoners lives  
The lady wore black  
See the years through the tears in her eyes  
The lady wore black  
Her mystic power calls to me  
The lady wore black  
Her love can set me free  
  
The wind song whispered a warning  
Telling me to beware  
Of the quiet shadowed woman  
And of the sadness I would share  
  
We sat together for sometime together in silence  
Never speaking in words  
Of all her thoughts she spoke with her eyes  
And I listened remembering all I heard  
  
The lady wore black  
It's the sign of the prisoners lives  
The lady wore black  
See the years through the tears in her eyes  
The lady wore black  
Her mystic power calls to me  
The lady wore black  
Her love can set me free  
  
The words she spoke were of forgotten lives  
And of all knowledge gained  
Memories I had and didn't know why  
With a smile she explained  
I should have listened to the wind's cold warning  
And walked the other way  
I touched her soul and now I bear her sentence  
But for her love I'll gladly pay

The evidence kept growing  
From below  
  
Hidden motivations  
Buried in the past  
Still gives us strength  
For the super thing  
  
The red alarm a rude surprise every time it rings  
Means it's time to go beyond the normal thing  
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right  
The super thing the thing that makes you bigger than life  
Won't you tell me what it takes  
To do the super thing  
  
Signals start to travel from a distant place  
Lights go out electro shock then pleasure pain  
Sensations unfamiliar can make you sick  
It's a superhuman thing and it does the trick

Our futures really do seem bright  
Women seem to forgive me  
They seem to become my very good friends  
But when it comes time for a commitment  
The romance always seems to end  
  
They tell me all their stories  
We lay awake and talk all night  
Maybe it's me I don't know  
But in the morning there always seems to be some kind of fight  
  
La la la la la  
Well women seem to be so clever  
I love all the jokes that they tell  
Like my last boyfriend really hurt me in bed  
Hey but you seem to fit so well  
Women sure can hurt your feelings  
They can burn you down and not make a sound  
And then they call me up and say hey come over  
My husband has just left town  
  
They tell me all their stories  
We lay awake and laugh all night  
Maybe it's me I don't know  
But in the morning there always seems to be some kind of fight  
  
Women seem to love houses  
I've bought a couple for one or two  
Women seem to think all men are louses  
And I guess I think so too  
Women seem so much smarter  
Than your average Joe  
Women seem to be a little more intuitive  
And when they lie nobody knows  
  
Well women seem to know how to keep a secret  
They don't blabbermouth just for show  
Fifty percent of their charm is illusion  
And that is a good thing to know

Once there was a time love was just a myth  
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist  
Til the day you came into my life  
You forced me to think twice  
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich  
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this  
That's why until this day I'm still your man  
Cause you made me understand that

To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain

The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself  
You connect with me like nobody else  
Even though our circumstances changed  
Our love still remains  
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly  
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely  
So no matter what tomorrow brings

Almost dead from his nightly sin  
Jonathan is deep asleep, a perfect time to visit the heap  
  
Down the hallway to the lair, down down the slippery stairs  
Abigail is in the crypt, a lantern in her hand  
  
The secret of the crypt  
A coghing made for a child, wondering who is inside  
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid  
  
The smell is sick  
Mummified in front on its side  
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife  
And it said: Abigail  
  
A silvery necklace was round the mummy's neck  
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge  
""What are you doing here"", Henry had come in unseen  
  
Abigail pulled on the necklace and the little mummy's head  
Was separated clean from it's tiny neck  
Then up up up, up into his throat  
Twisting and turning it, oh she couldn't stop  
  
Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood  
He was on the ground  
  
There's an eerie glow in the crypt down below  
Mummified infant on its side  
""Gotta go, gotta run, I'll be back for you little one""  
  
In the crypt Abigail's twin is searching for a home  
Abigail's twin is searching for her Mom  
But Mommy's in the floor and it's made of stone  
Her mommy's in the floor and she doesn't know  
Oh she doesn't know, she doesn't know  
Will she ever know

The deepest ocean to be by your side.

And neither have I wings to fly.  
I wish I could find me a handy boatman  
To ferry me over to my love and die.

Of happy days so long ago.  
My boyhood friends and my own relations.  
Have all passed on like the melting snow.  
  
So I'll spend my days in endless roving,  
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.  
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,  
On the long road down to the salty sea.  
  
And in Kilkenny it is reported  
On marble stone there as black as ink,  
With gold and silver I did support her  
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.  
  
I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,  
A handsome rover from town to town.  
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered

Name him Jesus, He'll light the way""

It appears that Air Force One was shot down  
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning  
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists, firing a Stinger Missile  
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for  
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown  
And he is presumed missing  
  
The Vice President, Secretary of State,  
And principals of the military are assembling  
Our nation stands at Defcon 3  
The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?  
I ""red, white and blew it""  
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained  
How could anybody do this?  
  
Betrayal, I peel away the days  
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me  
I'm not important, no one will ever come  
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell  
Nuclear battlefields energized  
Cold wars are heating up again  
The tensions mounting  
  
People lift up your fists in revenge  
The stage is set  
Who will be the first to blink?  
We can't go to war  
Remember that ""Vietnam thing""  
Peace at any price  
With a gun to your head, bang, bang  
  
Weakness runs in your family  
What runs in mine is death  
This is your 5 minute warning  
Burn all your classified documents  
And if cooler heads don't prevail  
First strike from a political dead man  
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive  
He understands only one language, action!  
And he respects only one word, force!  
No sign of them stopping,  
No time for back channel communiques  
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions!  
Retaliate, I say!  
  
The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war  
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities  
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground  
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence  
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours  
Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means  
And in hatred you see men as they really are  
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them  
All along, only another region of hell

And you feel you can touch,

And the seeds that are sown,

And you wish you could hide,  
Maybe go for a ride,  
To some peep show arcade,  
Where the future's not made.

Smacks of past Holy wars,  
By the wall with broken laws.

A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm

And combed his dark hair down  
And his mother cried as he walked out

He rode into a cattle town  
A smile upon his lips  
He stopped and walked into a bar  
And laid his money down

You give it up, you sacrifice  
And if necessary you comprimise  
Sometimes it's bitter sweet  
You've got to try eight days a week  
To create a good enough love to keep  
You see hearts belong to fire  
So does her love  
She burns me up with desire

I did my best, please understand  
I was late for one of our evening plans  
Champagne, dinner for two  
With candlelight, she set the mood  
But there wasn't anything I could do  
  
But, she is so forgiving  
The one thing I know is  
It's off her love I'm living

She knows I think about her face  
Till I get home  
Till I get back home  
What we gonna do tonight?  
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside  
So let's just love until we get things right  
And waste a whole lotta time

I tell her things she can't repeat  
Makes her little heart just skip a beat  
She blush a little bit  
And then I find  
She doesn't, she doesn't

Sometimes I like to be alone  
Ring the girl on her private line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
Go to work early, come back late  
Outta my head, can't concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
She's better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind  
She doesn't, she doesn't

Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts  
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks  
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats

When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow  
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos  
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin' hollows  
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision  
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision  
It seems like greed's the world religion  
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons  
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes  
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die  
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers  
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years  
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!

To be or not to be the man, that's the question  
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined  
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it

I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm

For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real  
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible

There's a rainbow highway to be found,  
Leading from your window pane,  
To a place behind the sun,  
Just a step beyond the rain.  
  
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,  
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue,  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday, I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow,

If all those little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,

Along with her name  
Nobody came  
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands  
As he walks from the grave  
No one was saved  
  
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?  
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told

Yeah I wanna be a man.

I ain't gonna tell.  
Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay.""  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same

Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
""You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?  
I don't think this is, working out for us.  
Why?  
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.

A mighty Indian tribe  
But the winds of change,  
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
The white man's greed, in search of gold  
Made the nation bleed  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.  
  
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.  
  
They were driven hard, across the plains  
And walked for many moons  
Cause the winds of change,  
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
So much to bear, all that pain  
Left them in despair  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn

'Bout what makes a man a man  
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born  
We just couldn't understand  
  
Our old man didn't like our appearance  
He said that only women wear long hair  
  
So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother  
We knew what we had to do  
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium  
And got our arms tattooed  
  
Welcome to my life, tattoo  
I'm a man now, thanks to you  
I expect I'll regret you  
But the skin graft man won't get you  
You'll be there when I die  
Tattoo  
  
My dad beat me 'cause mine said ""Mother""  
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother  
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude  
And my mother thought that was extremely rude  
  
Welcome to my life, tattoo  
We've a long time together, me and you  
I expect I'll regret you  
But the skin graft man won't get you  
You'll be there when I die

Now I'm older, I'm tattooed all over  
My wife is tattooed too

Maybe give me insight between black and white  
The best thing you've ever done for me  
Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all  
Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable  
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear  
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket  
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore.  
  
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains  
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain  
There's more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine.  
  
I went to see the doctor of philosophy  
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee  
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie  
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me  
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper  
And I was free.  
  
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains  
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain  
There's more than one answer to these questions  
Pointing me in crooked line  
The less I seek my source for some definitive  
The closer I am to fine.  
  
I stopped by the bar at 3 A. M.  
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend  
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board  
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before  
I went in seeking clarity.  
  
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains

No one to help you, your friends don't have the time  
So you ride around in your car, switch on the radio  
You want to relate to something you once read in a book  
What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey  
Until I got hurt, 'til I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry  
But the tears you shed are only in your eye  
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell  
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion  
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't [  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
Young son, don't let me down, young son  
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now  
Hold on, never let go, now hold on  
Turn your heart to the bright sun  
Love will come your way  
Cause 'till you make that final show  
You'll never know what love you've been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on  
You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along  
( But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now ! You might be gone  
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong

That Tec-eleven, A-K forty seven, one Beretta, ready for whatever  
Tell them pussy niggas come together  
Happy better nigga, nigga super soaker wetter nigga  
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga  
I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga  
Thirty years old, shit that'll be a giving nigga  
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening  
But she ain't really trippin', 'cause the pots is pissed in  
Them niggas tripping, until the shots whistling'  
Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention  
I gotta bitch, and quit calling women bitches  
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen  
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it  
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quitting  
There you go shitting on a way a nigga thanking  
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin  
This is the future ain't promised to no one  
I live everyday like this is the sure one  
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean  
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fucking snow come  
And it feels so fucking good  
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull  
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches  
Running cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune  
Come and get it, automatics in motion  
We banging for the bread nigga, even the molded  
I got my loaf, I got my toast  
Chaperon of the south, I got my coast, yea  
And until I die I'm the, the, the, the, the best rapper alive

Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind  
  
But soon love is broken, they'll take you away  
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief  
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves  
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean

A smile from your lady friend looking down  
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver  
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save

Ah the letter that I read from you read this way  
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start  
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone  
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend  
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold  
  
Remember the rivers that once did flow clean  
  
Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning 'round  
All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die  
All except for a few of us hangers on  
Living each day with trivial hearts  
  
We just stop once in a while cry over the news  
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down  
  
Because there was a reason a gun had a hand  
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope  
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land  
Soon in my country there won't be a friend  
Each one is trying so hard to defend  
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away

Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it  
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it  
So now you at the store for some blank cds  
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it  
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you  
And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball  
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all  
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Intro:  
  
Listen you fuckers, you screwheads  
Here's a man who won't take it anymore  
A man who stood up against  
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit  
Here is some one who stood up  
Here is...  
  
Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies  
presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life  
Yeah! check it  
  
Verse One:  
  
It took a long time comin but we waited  
Xzibit went from underated  
To now most antcipaded  
never would of thought that I would rock your set  
And get love and respect without no special effects  
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need  
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed  
thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed  
Tryin to glority greed  
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!  
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed  
Have it laid out for your seed  
But the world gets colder every day by day  
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.  
Trying to find piece of mind  
is like trying to find a gold mine  
it just won't happen  
no time for relaxin  
Real soldiers of fortune  
the front line of the action  
So never show a nigga what you packin'  
""You know what i'm sayin'?""  
It's too much weight to be juggling  
who do you picture when you think about struggling  
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin  
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah!  
yes movin...  
At the speed of life  
  
Verse Two:  
  
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes  
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind  
and when I die!  
Niggas still recite these lines  
to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns  
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  
the underground! to upper echelon and beyond  
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond  
Nigga want to trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch  
mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon  
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone  
It's the law of the land  
a straight modern day babylon!  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah! yeah! like this  
Like this...at the speed of life  
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!  
  
Verse Three:  
  
Xzibit lookin at the earth through wide angles  
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels  
Where small situations turn to altercation  
with a heavy ass price  
'cause niggas don't fight no more!  
before hip hop was all about drama  
anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona  
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma  
Just me and my bottle  
we shall lead not follow  
Emcees be full of shit  
but they style be hollow  
it seems you've bitin off more  
than you can possibly swallow  
just a day in the life of a man named X  
only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex  
you see niggas comin through to smoke and pay respect  
ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything  
whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion  
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion  
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst  
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first  
Yeah! we got it locked down tight  
Xzibit bring truth to the light  
shit is movin at the speed of life  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...  
At the speed of life

Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.  
There are frail forms fainting at the door.  
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.

With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.  
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,

No, my life's a trial

Getting away before it gets any worse today

Your not admitting, you should be quitting  
All these queens and fairies, and muscle Mary's

No cigarettes, and you'll feel a little less worth

I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,  
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,  
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.  
  
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,  
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,  
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,  
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.  
  
I said, father, there's so much to know,  
There's a world of things to see,  
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself  
If you give me what is mine,  
I will go, if I can have your blessing,  
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.  
Son, I've always tried my best for you,  
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of God.  
  
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,  
I met a travelling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,  
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,  
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,  
He said, no, it isn't that bad.  
And then a few days later, on an old city road,  
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,  
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,  
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.  
  
Then a famine hit and drained the land,  
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was so hard to find,  
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,  
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.  
I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,  
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,  
I had to eat with the swine,  
The bread I ate was like stone,  
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.  
Oh, the servants there are better fed,  
If I could only have what my father gives them,  
I would truly need nothing more.  
Oh, I will go and say to him,  
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,  
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them.  
  
It didn't take too long to pack my things,  
I left with only what I wore,  
As I prayed that I still had a home.  
I was near home, in site of the house,  
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,  
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,  
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,  
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,  
I've learned that my home is right where you are,  
Oh father, take me in.  
Bring the best robe, put it on my son,  
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,  
This is my son who I thought had died,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,  
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,  
My son was dead and he's now alive,  
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,  
My son was dead,  
My son was lost,  
My son's returned in the hands of God.

When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, go  
Won't let you go, go, go, go, go won't let you go  
No, go, go, go, go, no no no

Our affair has been quite heated  
You thought I was what you needed  
But the time has come, my darlin'

Gotta go now...  
Keep that hankie that I gave you for  
When you cry  
There are things that trouble me  
And I'm sure that you must see  
That it breaks my heart the same as yours

His mother cried  
I saw the crown of thorns He wore  
The stripes upon His back  
The water and the blood ran out  
And then the sky turned black  
My mind was filled with anger  
My heart was filled with shame

Who could bring Him pain  
Why does it seem the strong  
Always victimize the weak?

Standing to my feet

Who nailed Him there?  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there?""

An ordinary man  
I love my wife and children  
I do the best I can  
How could I have killed Him?  
It must be someone else  
There's got to be an answer  
I just can't blame myself  
And I cried, ""Who nailed Him there?

Come and face me like a man

When you chose to move away

Say I've been missed but I wouldn't know  
I might be better off living on my own

Promised the distance wouldn't change a thing

When he was a young man  
Handsome, and like a reed so tall  
With a face like an old photograph  
She would fall for him  
Fall for him  
She would fall  
  
She wore her mother's cocktail dress  
With saddle shoes  
She was pretty and she was small  
She worked the switchboard  
Down the hall from him  
Down the hall

He said: ""Hello little woman""  
She said: ""Hello big man""  
And that was how the wooing  
And the winning began  
He said: ""Hello little woman""  
She said: ""Hello big man""  
  
Of course New York in those days  
Was carriage rides and matinees  
He took her to a ball  
At the Waldorf Astoria  
He would fall for her  
Fall for her, he would fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could hear them laugh  
As they danced in their room  
And the shadows on the avenue  
Rose into a jealous moon  
Which swung low in the dawn light  
To see what was going on with those two  
  
You keep on expecting  
Something to go wrong  
And nothing does  
They still live in the house  
Where we were born  
Pictures of us kids  
Hanging up all over the walls  
  
And some say he built his empire  
For wealth and fame  
But, if you ask him why  
He'll say he did it all for her  
All for her  
All for her

Home where my thought's escaping home where the music's playing  
Home where my love was waitin' silently for me

And each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories  
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be  
Homeward bound...

So we'll argue and we'll compromise  
And realize that nothing's ever changed  
For all our mutual experience  
Our separate conclusions are the same  
  
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity  
Though we choose between reality and madness  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies  
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies  
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities

Lay down on the ground and let the tears run from you,  
Crying to the grass and trees and heaven finally on your knees  
  
Let me live again, let life come find me wanting.  
Spring must strike again against the shield of winter.  
Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,  
Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again.

Sometimes I think that we could just be friends  
'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me  
  
And what about our future plans?  
Does it seem we have even make sense?  
When I got the whole world in front of me  
  
So I said, ""I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I love gypsy life  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
Maybe we can see the world together  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight, tonight""  
  
So I just packed my baggage and  
Said goodbye to family and friends  
And took the road to nowhere on my own  
  
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick  
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick  
'Cause I left everyone I love at home  
  
And I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I love gypsy life  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
Maybe we can see world together  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight, tonight  
  
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy, I'm  
  
And then he asked me,  
Said, ""Baby, why do we love each other?""  
I said, ""Honey, it's simple.  
It's the way that you love and treat your mother""  
  
Thought that I would be alone forever  
But I won't be tonight  
I'm a man without a home  
But I think with you I can spend my life  
And you'll be my little gypsy princess  
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset  
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets  
'Cause it's you and me  
Baby, for life  
  
Would you go with me?  
(For life)  
See the world with me  
  
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy I'm  
  
Russia, UK, Paris, I'm  
Italian, Asian, Kompai  
Africa, India, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy I'm  
Latin American, I don't speak German but I try  
Someday in Jakarta, I'm  
American, I'm gypsy I  
Bangkok, Australia, Malaysia  
Sweden, Finland, Norway  
Be my home just for the day  
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy hey

We give 'em credit, you can call the bank  
It's just a business, you can pay us in crude  
You'll love these toys, just go play out your feuds  
We've got no pride, don't care whose boots we lick  
We act so greedy, makes me sick sick sick  
  
So get up, stand up, out of my way  
I want to talk to the boss right away  
Get up, stand up, whose gonna pay  
I want to talk to the man right away  
  
We walk the highwire  
Sending the men up to the front line  
Hoping they don't catch the hell fire  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Sending the men to the front line  
And tell 'em to pipe in the sunshine  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
Our lives are threatened, our jobs at risk  
Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist  
Another Munich we just can't afford  
We're gonna send in the eighty-second airborne  
  
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay  
I want to talk to the boss right away  
Get up, stand up, outta my way  
I want to talk to the man right away  
  
We walk the highwire  
Putting the world on a deadline  
And hoping we don't taste the shellfire  
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Putting the world on a deadline  
Catching the bite on the prime time  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
Get up! Stand up!  
Dealer! Stealer!  
  
We walk the highwire  
We send our men to the front lines  
An' we're hoping that we backed the right side  
With hot guns and cold, cold nights  
  
We walk the highwire  
Send our men to the front lines  
And hoping they don't catch the hellfire  
With hot guns and cold cold, cold, cold,  
Cold nights  
  
Yeah! Oh yeah!  
  
We walk the highwire  
We walk the highwire  
Oh Yeah  
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold nights  
  
Oh yeah!

Now they seem  
Oh so far away  
All your fears  
I fear I once shared  
Now I know  
  
There's a future  
For all of us  
Not so long ago  
I was so scared  
You seemed so sad  
I could see  
  
Through your twisted smile  
So unsure  
Always confused  
Pale blue eyes  
Gazing down  
From your ivory tower  
Through the haze  
  
All broken and bruised  
Then: out of the blue  
Love came rushing in  
Out of the sky  
Came the sun  
Out of left field  
Came a lucky day  
Out of the blue  
No more pain  
I don't mind  
If it's only  
A passing craze  
Throwaway lines  
Often ring true  
If I were you  
  
I would stay  
For a little while  
I you were me  
Would you walk out  
In style?
